<p>Example 1</p>
<p></p>
<p>Initial Phone Notes</p>
<p>Joe's Dental Project</p>
<p>There's a long story about janitorial and office supplies that we need to tease out from Meg</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hmm</p>
<p>##It'll be good to remind Joe of our key offerings</p>
<p>- Nice people</p>
<p>- We smile a lot</p>
<p>- We like pets</p>
<p></p>
<p>Example 2</p>
<p></p>
<p>Simplest Backlog</p>
<p>We'l be meeting with Joe on Mon/Wed/Fri from 9-10. At all times Office Manager will be available</p>
<p>Level 0 - easiest backlog entry. Joe's Dentist Office</p>
<p>LABEL</p>
<p>eastyam is a compiler for business intent.</p>
<p>It's goal is to provide the minimal amount of structure</p>
<p>necessary to capture and remember important business</p>
<p>conversations, taking that information in one</p>
<p>place and distributing wherever it's needed.</p>
<p>Keywords are in ALL CAPS. Everything else is unstuctured</p>
<p>This is an example of a freeform file, the kind</p>
<p>of notes that might be taken at a meeting with a</p>
<p>new client.</p>
<p>SUPPL</p>
<p></p>
<p>ASA Customer</p>
<p>INEEDTO Schedule Birthday Parties</p>
<p></p>
<p>It outputs two things</p>
<p>filename and Structured Analysis Tag in a format that can be re-</p>
<p>used to input it back into the system. In this way the compiler</p>
<p>alongside with git can be used to "clean up" a bunch of SA notes</p>
<p>into a universal text format. Secondly, it outputs all of the files</p>
<p>in a detailed, cross-referenced format. So, for instance, a User</p>
<p>Story for the upcoming sprint will have all of the supplemental</p>
<p>and parent acceptance and description criteria automatically</p>
<p>attached to it. (There are also a few debug outputs available)</p>
<p>These outputs can be used in dozens of additional business intent</p>
<p>pipeline programs. Some possible uses are</p>
<p>activity diagram generator, domain model generator, help desk</p>
<p>script creation, manual acceptance test script creation, production</p>
<p>system monitoring scripts, release plan reports, burn-downs and</p>
<p>burn-ups, sprint snapshots, and so on.</p>
<p>Basically anywhere business intent is resued in the project, a</p>
<p>pipeline tool should be able to convert these notes into useful</p>
<p>information consumed by automated tools and humans alike.</p>
<p>Here's an example of how information might be organized around</p>
<p>user stories. Teams are free to organize information however they</p>
<p>see fit. (Note</p>
<p>move from fuzzy and disorganized to concrete and highly organized)</p>
<p>YOU WOULD NEVER CREATE A FILE LIKE THIS ON ITS OWN.</p>
<p>Instead, information contained here is gathered through</p>
<p>natural conversations in a slipshod, scattershot manner. This is</p>
<p>simply and example of how such information might be collected after</p>
<p>dozens of conversations about all kinds of other things that affect</p>
<p>this desired behavior</p>

<p>Here's an example of Hypothesis-Driven Backlogs</p>
<p>A Hypothesis is connected to desired changes which</p>
<p>drive a backlog</p>
<p>All together this forms a business case, a financial</p>
<p>justification for changes to the baseline system</p>
<p>BUSINESS HYPOTHESIS</p>
<p>Service speed drives order size</p>
<p>OBSERVATION</p>
<p>Total wait time and order size might be related</p>
<p>On low productivity days sales go down</p>
<p>EXPECTED ACTORS IMPACTED</p>
<p>Walk-in Customer</p>
<p>EXPECTED IMPACT METRIC GIVEN</p>
<p>Average Line Time IS UNKNOWN</p>
<p>Average Order Wait Time IS 3 minutes STD(2.5)</p>
<p>Average Sale Amount IS $3.50 STD(1.00)</p>
<p>EXPECTED SUCESSFUL RESULT</p>
<p>Average Line Time WILLBE 2 minutes STD(1.5)</p>
<p>AVerage Order Wait Time WILLBE 2 minutes STD(1.5)</p>
<p>Average Sale Amount WILLBE $5.00 STD(1.00)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here is where the hypothesis connects to the model</p>
<p>PROPOSED CHANGE TO TEST HYPOTHESIS</p>
<p>BUSINESS SUPPLEMENTAL</p>
<p>Order Clerk scripts are edited and practiced to be < 10 sec</p>
<p>Time from store entry until push-out is recorded</p>
<p>BUSINESS BEHAVIOR</p>
<p>Order Lemonade</p>
<p>BUSINESS STRUCTURE</p>
<p>EXPECTED EXPERIMENT SUSPENSE TIME</p>
<p>1 month</p>
<p>Just like behavior can be explicitly</p>
<p>diagrammed out using text, structure can</p>
<p>be also.</p>
<p>Here's a domain model.</p>
<p>Note that in all of these types of models, behavior,</p>
<p>structure, supplemental, and meta, items can be</p>
<p>listed by themselves initially or as part of a</p>
<p>diagram (an item/relationship list) duplicates</p>
<p>are treated as the same item. The only rule is that</p>
<p>there cannot be conflicting definitions</p>
<p>Domain (structure) models are forced into</p>
<p>It's usually good to keep noun clauses singular and capitalize them</p>

<p>Product Backlog example</p>
<p>This means they must be identified by their parent item,</p>
<p>Identifying the parent brings in all the parent's detail,</p>
<p>notes, questions, supplementals, etc. so that data</p>
<p>entry is not repeated.</p>
<p>One of the things this type of result file could be used for is printing User Story cards</p>

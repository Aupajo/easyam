Product Backlog example

Backlog items are BUSINESS BEHAVIOR REALIZED TO-BE Items

This means they must be identified by their parent item,
the BUSINESS BEHAVIOR ABSTRACT TO-BE Items.

Identifying the parent brings in all the parent's detail,
notes, questions, supplementals, etc. so that data
entry is not repeated.

One of the things this type of result file could be used for is printing User Story cards

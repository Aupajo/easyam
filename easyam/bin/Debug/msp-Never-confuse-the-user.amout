BUSINESS SUPPLEMENTAL ABSTRACT TO-BE: Never confuse the user
    BECAUSE: 
      We deal in complicated logistics concepts
    WHENEVER: 
      We explain what we're doing to the user
    ITHASTOBETHAT: 
      The average 6-year-old barely paying attention to the transaction can understand what's going on

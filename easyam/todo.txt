? Remove default sub-directory creation. Just send all to output

X SCENARIO needs to be a keyword for behavior - that shows up in feature file output. A type of attribute.

X basic feature file generation needs to be added, including parent mus info, comments, and notes

* add name/value tags in

- feature file generation with supplementals

- add an option to do round-trip modeling from the command line

- Add in a rename function from command line

- filtering/ordering output by namespace and/or name-value tags

- Needs some way of queue ordering instead of having to prefix.

- Should we have some new way of handling points instead of making it a comment? Don't want it on cards

- EXAMPLE FIle, the scenario notes are being attached to the wrong feature

- basic test plan output for a given sprint, including parent mus info, comments, and supplementals and notes

- auto SVG domain model creation, including a frame html file

- add tasks
- add bugs
- model check: make sure you can only add attributes to where they belong
- model check: make sure parents and children are of the same genre
- Add diagrams output where needed
- Add back in html documentation output

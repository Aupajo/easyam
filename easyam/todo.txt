TODO
-----
- On single-file output, kick out NAMESPACES and tags (check that they round-trip)
- Ditto for canonical output

- More feature file output as part of default
- Test plans too? Basic test plan output for a given sprint, including parent mus info, comments, and supplementals and notes
- Tasks and bugs
- Bunch of model check stuff
	- model check: make sure you can only add attributes to where they belong
	- model check: make sure parents and children are of the same genre
	- limit the complexity of any one layer to enforce simplicity
- Complete the default html doco output


- EXTENSION IDEAS
  - Trello load
  - rename item
  - excel (csv) output
  - auto SVG domain model creation, including a frame html file
